        <h1>Connaught Square</h1>
        <h2>
          Position Connaught Square as the single most exciting.
          <span>Cool</span> destination to live in Digbeth AND Birmingham.
        </h2>

        <p>
          A multi-billion pound transformation underway in Birmingham is
          poised to reshape the skyline and create the city of the future.</p>
        <p>
          Connaught Square is the most anticipated development in a generation
          and an icon of regeneration set to enhance lifestyles and work
          opportunities in Birmingham - opening up the city’s creative
          heartland of Digbeth to the modern day city centre.</p>
        <p> The landmark
          retail and homes project will feature a stunning new public realm
          where people can meet and relax, host festivals and street markets -
          rivalling London’s Shoreditch or New York’s East Village. </p>
        <p>It will
          encompass the long-awaited revival of Birmingham’s historic River
          Rea - the waterway on which the city was founded by the Beorma tribe
          in the 7th century, and the fictional scene of many a Peaky Blinder
          adventure. </p>
        <p>A riverside walkway and terrace run will see the
          waterside haven opened up to the public for the first time since the
          Edwardian era.</p>
        <p> A stunning 26-storey stone and glass tower will form
          the landmark entrance to Connaught Square which will be home to 770
          apartments.</p>
        <p> The residents of the development’s gateway tower, known
          as One Connaught Square, will be at the forefront of their
          generation, highly sought-after talent, the entrepreneurs of the
          future.</p>
        <p>They may work in Birmingham, or commute to London via HS2.....
          Connaught Square represents the truly vibrant, creative and intelligent lifestyle that Digbeth embodies.</p>
        <p>
          As part of the wider Eastside and Southside regeneration, Connaught Square will usher in the rise of a new
          cultural hub
          within our fast-growing, progressive and diverse city.
          Connaught Square will deliver 780 apartments over four unique buildings - filled with character, surrounded by
          brand-new
          urban spaces…..</p>

      <h3><span>HISTORY IN THE MAKING</span><br></h3>

      <h4> Bradford Street </h4>
      <p>In 1767, Henry Bradford donated free land here to anyone willing to
        establish a trade. It’s been suggested that this was the catalyst
        for Digbeth’s growth along industrial lines. At one point, there
        were over 20 pubs on Bradford Street catering for workers. Today,
        there are just three.
        <img src="./images/oldpub.jpg" alt="">

      </p>

      <h4>Fazeley Street </h4>
      <p> The street is in the centre of Birmingham’s former industrial
        heartland and was part of the Italian
        quarter up until the Second World War. A symbol of Digbeth’s
        renaissance is Fazeley Studios, a key creative venue housed in a
        converted 150-year-old church. The studios are home for tech
        businesses specialising in disciplines ranging from holographics to
        virtual reality. They also house the Fazeley Social Restaurant and
        Bar as well as a café and meeting rooms for events and corporate
        functions.
        <img src="./images/fazeley.jpg" alt="">

      </p>

      <h4>Digbeth High Street </h4>
      <p>The street once made for a picturesque thoroughfare, far removed from its later industrialised
        look. Historian William Dargue recounts how there were once many
        timber-framed buildings, “which had been fronted with handsome brick
        facades in Georgian times”. Industrial plants such as Phoenix Works,
        Birmingham Battery and Metal Works and Devonshire Works, the former
        Alfred Bird & Sons plant, could be found on the high street. Sir
        Alfred’s former plant, founded in 1837, is now home to the Custard
        Factory, a centre for creative businesses and projects that
        officially opened in August 1993. Today, the high street is home to
        venues including The Irish Centre, centrepoint of a community that
        has been in the city since the 1600s, and the O2 Institute
        nightclub. A St Patrick’s Day Parade has passed along the road since
        1952 and is now the world’s largest after New York and Dublin. The
        JFK memorial is one of the brightest and most recognisable murals in
        Digbeth.
        <img src="./images/digbethCopy.jpg" alt="">

      </p>

      <h4>Heath Mill Lane </h4>
      <p>The lane once provided a route from the main road to a corn mill
        founded by the de Birmingham family in the
        13th Century. It’s a key part of Digbeth in an area where the
        creative industries have taken shape in former industrial buildings.
        Rhubarb, which offers office space to creative businesses, is part
        of the regeneration – the humorous name being a reference to the
        former Custard Factory

      <h3>IGNITING CREATIVITY</h3>

      <h4>Clean Kilo</h4>
      <p>
        The UK’s largest zero-waste supermarket - Clean Kilo follows an ethos of sourcing local and selling
        plastic-free.
        Described as pioneers in food retail, The Clean Kilo has heavily contributed to the resurgence of Digbeth High
        Street
        and continues to work with both Birmingham City Council and the local community to spread their message -
        educating
        young people on plastic pollution and developing initiatives to tackle food waste. </p>

      <h4>Digbeth Dining Club</h4>
      <p>
        A street food market that launched in 2012, Digbeth Dining Club is one of the quarter’s biggest draws. Open
        every
        Thursday, Friday and Saturday, DDC is a showcase of the best food vendors in the Midlands, nestled amongst the
        backstreets and archways that make up Digbeth. Combining award-winning street food and vibrant events, all
        backed by
        soundtracks from homegrown artists and music collectives, Digbeth Dining Club is a demonstration of everything
        that
        makes Digbeth great.
      </p>
      <h4>Baked in Brick</h4>
      <p>A Digbeth Dining Club alumni helmed by an award-winning street food vendor, Baked in Brick is one of
        Digbeth’s most
        exciting new restaurants. Featuring a full-size Mini Cooper in the wall (a throwback to when owner Lee
        Desanges would
        cook street food under the bonnet of a 1964 model Mini) and a mouth-watering menu of wood-fired pizza or
        chicken tikka
        wraps, Baked in Brick is a self-made success story that started life at the heart of Digbeth.
      </p>
      <h4>The Framers</h4>
      <p>Offering a bespoke picture framing service for clients, galleries and corporations - The Framers is a perfect
        example of
        the artistic talent that can be found in and around Digbeth. One of the first businesses to be established
        within The
        Custard Factory, The Framers also houses the Studio 4 gallery.
      </p>
      <h4>Custard Factory</h4>
      <p>Possibly the most iconic building in Digbeth, the Custard Factory represents the creative heart and soul of
        the quarter.
        Officially described as an independent shopping destination and creative digital workspace, The Custard
        Factory hosts
        everything from events, movies, cafes and shopping to offices, creative areas and communal spaces. Originally
        built in
        1906 to produce Bird’s Custard, the Custard Factory remains an icon amongst the growing Birmingham landscape.
      </p>
      <h4>Irish community</h4>
      <p>
        The annual St Patrick’s Day parade and festival is the focal point of the Irish community – turning parts of
        the city
        into a sea of green.
        The Emerald Isle celebration is the third biggest in the world, attracting around 90,000 people a year and
        beaten only
        by New York City and then Dublin.
        The major community event traditionally includes a parade, music stage, street food stalls and Emerald Mile
        fun run.
        Birmingham is said to have the largest Irish population in the UK as well as Britain's only Irish Quarter,
        centred on
        Digbeth.
        The parade goes back to 1952 and was the first of its kind in the UK. It's taken place in Digbeth every year
        since 1996.

      <h3>Birmingham’s Golden Age of Development
      </h3>


      <h4>Birmingham Rising</h4>

      <p>
        Birmingham is a global destination experiencing a golden age of development, brimming with the confidence
        afforded by
        huge inward investment, incredible amenities and a thriving cultural scene. As cranes fill the skyline, the
        second city
        is completely transforming its landscape and infrastructure, building a smart, refined commercial offering
        while
        delivering extraordinary residential and leisure spaces.
        Rich in independent culture, retail, leisure and gastronomy, Birmingham consistently outranks other major UK
        cities for
        quality of life, affordability and career options. With the arrival of HS2 in 2026, direct access to the
        capital
        will
        make Birmingham an even more attractive choice for London commuters seeking the richness and vibrancy that
        Birmingham
        has in abundance.</p>

      <h4>Fueling the Fires of Business</h4>
      <p>
        The youngest city in Europe, Birmingham and its surroundings are home to over one million jobs located
        amongst
        global
        brands such as HSBC, PwC, the BBC and the Royal Bank of Scotland. By developing a talented workforce across
        a
        number of
        progressive sectors, Birmingham has built the largest business, professional and financial services hub
        outside
        of
        London. This commercial centre of excellence employs more than 100,000 people, attracting the eyes of the
        world
        and a
        variety of world-class occupiers.</p>

      <h4>Big City Plan</h4>
      <p>
        Birmingham’s Golden Age of Development was kickstarted by the Big City Plan - a 20-year project to
        revitalise
        and
        transform Birmingham’s key quarters. Covering every aspect of the ‘built environment’, the Big City Plan
        features a huge
        development pipeline including the Bullring, the regeneration of New Street Station, Grand Central, HS2,
        Birmingham
        Smithfield, Paradise, Arena Central and the Midland Metro Expansion, revitalising commercial, residential
        and
        infrastructure developments in the second city. It includes aspirations to create 50,000 new jobs and
        contribute
        £2.1billion to the economy each year and deliver exciting new public and commercial spaces. Focused on
        regenerating key
        areas around Birmingham, the ‘Big City Plan’ is one of the most ambitious, far-reaching development
        projects
        undertaken
        in the UK.</p>

      <h4>HS2 (Curzon Street Station)</h4>
      <p>
        HS2 will revolutionise connectivity and travel between Birmingham and London, reducing commuting times
        between
        the two
        cities to just 49 minutes and boosting Birmingham’s own economy by 4.2%. HS2 is designed to be the
        backbone of
        the rail
        network and would eventually connect 8 of Britain’s largest cities and over 30 million people, creating
        30,000
        jobs and
        delivering an estimated £40 million for the community.
      </p>
      <h4>Midland Metro Expansion <br>(part of Eastside regeneration)</h4>
      <p>
        The Midland Metro will help boost connectivity across the wider West Midlands, offering direct links to
        Edgbaston, the
        NEC and Wolverhampton as well as connecting a rejuvenated Eastside district and One Connaught Square to
        the rest
        of
        Birmingham. The expansion is estimated to be completed by 2022 and forecasting a GDV of £137 million.</p>

      <h4>Birmingham Smithfield<br>the Core of the City</h4>
      <p>
        Birmingham Smithfield has a unique history as the ‘birthplace’ of Birmingham, where the second city
        started life
        as a
        market town before evolving into the sophisticated global hub it is today. The Smithfield Masterplan
        will
        reimagine and
        revitalise Birmingham’s Eastside and Southside quarters, injecting £1.5 billion into the creative
        district and
        transforming the region into an exciting destination to live, work and play. Delivering 2,000 houses.
        Over 20
        years,
        Birmingham Smithfield will add £470 million GVA to the local economy and create nearly 3,000 new jobs.</p>

      <h4>Arena Central</h4>
      <p>
        A major development in the heart of the city, Arena Central has a GDV of £500 million and will span
        1.2 million
